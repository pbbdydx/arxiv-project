{"id": "math/9201266v1", "title": "Some basic information on information-based complexity theory", "abstract": "Numerical analysts might be expected to pay close attention to a branch of complexity theory called information-based complexity theory (IBCT), which produces an abundance of impressive results about the quest for approximate solutions to mathematical problems. Why then do most numerical analysts turn a cold shoulder to IBCT? Close analysis of two representative papers reveals a mixture of nice new observations, error bounds repackaged in new language, misdirected examples, and misleading theorems.   Some elements in the framework of IBCT, erected to support a rigorous yet flexible theory, make it difficult to judge whether a model is off-target or reasonably realistic. For instance, a sharp distinction is made between information and algorithms restricted to this information. Yet the information itself usually comes from an algorithm, so the distinction clouds the issues and can lead to true but misleading inferences. Another troublesome aspect of IBCT is a free parameter $F$, the class of admissible problem instances. By overlooking $F$'s membership fee, the theory sometimes distorts the economics of problem solving in a way reminiscent of agricultural subsidies.   The current theory's surprising results pertain only to unnatural situations, and its genuinely new insights might serve us better if expressed in the conventional modes of error analysis and approximation theory.", "authors": "Beresford N.

These models have been used to study he behavior of this compartment under such pathological clinical conditions s hydrocephalus, head injury and brain edema. The number of different pproaches has led to considerable confusion regarding the validity, accuracy or appropriateness of the various models. In this paper we review the mathematical basis for these models in a mplified fashion, leaving the mathematical details to appendices. We show at most previous models are in fact particular cases of a single basic differential equation describing the evolution in time of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CFS). Central to this approach is the hypothsis that the rate change of CSF volume with respect to pressure is a measure of the compliance of the brain tissue which as a consequence leads to particular models epending on the form of the compliance funtion. All such models in fact give essentially no information on the behavior of the brain itself. More recent models (solved numerically using the Finite Element Method) have begun to address this issue but have difficulties due to the lack of information about the mechanical properties of the brain.

A direct evaluation of these rotations yields a linear drift of the distance to the origin. This is due to roundoff in the representation of the sine s and cosine c of the angle theta.

In the present paper we present a method to find pairs of representable real numbers s and c such that c^2 + s^2 is as close to 1 as possible.

To determine stream function Dirichlet problem for Laplace equation is solved. Numerical solution is obtained using five-point scheme, and analytical - by conformal mapping. It is demonstrated that numerical solution fits very accurately with the analytical one. Then in the already known gas flow field trajectories of particles of different size are calculated in Lagrange formulation, taking into account dust particles as well as filtering water drops.

A principal problem is to find a dual system $\\gamma_{m,n}(k) = \\gamma_m(k-an)$ such that each function $f$ can be written as $f = \\sum < f, \\gamma_{m,n} > g_{m,n}$. The mathematical theory usually addresses this problem in infinite dimensions (typically in $L_2(R)$ or $l_2(Z)$), whereas numerical methods have to operate with a finite-dimensional model. Exploiting the link between the frame operator and Laurent operators with matrix-valued symbol, we apply the finite section method to show that the dual functions obtained by solving a finite-dimensional problem converge to the dual functions of the original infinite-dimensional problem in $l_2(Z)$. For compactly supported $g_{m,n}$ (FIR filter banks) we prove an exponential rate of convergence and derive explicit expressions for the involved constants.

The coordinate-free approach is a factorization approach but does not require the coprime factorizations of the plant. We present two criteria for feedback stabilizability for MIMO systems in which transfer functions belong to the total rings of fractions of commutative rings. Both of them are generalizations of Sule's results in [SIAM J. Control Optim., 32-6, 1675-1695(1994)]. The first criterion is expressed in terms of modules generated from a causal plant and does not require the plant to be strictly causal.

In contrast to Genetic Algorithms which operate on an entire ``gene-pool'' of possible solutions, Extremal Optimization improves on a single candidate solution by treating each of its components as species co-evolving according to Darwinian principles. Unlike Simulated Annealing, its non-equilibrium approach effects an algorithm requiring few parameters to tune. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance proves competitive with, and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization procedures.

The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read \"n choose k\", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read \"n cycle k\", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read \"n subset k\".

In the field-theoretic description of interactive games the dialogues are defined naively as interactive games of discrete time with intention fields of continuous time; the correct mathematical formulation is proposed. The states and the controls of a dialogue correspond to the speech whereas the intention fields describe the understanding. In the case of dialogues the main inverse problem is to describe geometrical and algebraical properties of the understanding. On the other hand, a precise mathematical definition of dialogues allows to formulate a problem of the unraveling of a hidden dialogue structure of any 2-person differential interactive game. Such procedure is called the verbalization.

There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models.   High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models.

Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree.

Starting with an examination of the relationship between random effects and fixed effects estimators in the standard unobserved effects model, this article demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the mixed model approach has a ``bias compression'' property under a general model for individual heterogeneity that can mitigate bias due to uncontrolled differences among individuals.

On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation.

We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.", "authors": "N.

The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration.

In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers.

Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).   As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one.

We employ a gradual, information-based concept of ``unknownness'' providing a uniform treatment for the range of completely known to maximally unknown lexical entries. ``Unknown'' information is viewed as revisable information, which is either generalizable or specializable. Updating takes place after parsing, which only requires a modified lexical lookup. Revisable pieces of information are identified by grammar-specified declarations which provide access paths into the parse feature structure. The updating mechanism revises the corresponding places in the lexical feature structures iff the context actually provides new information. For revising generalizable information, type union is required.

The new approach is illustrated with an implemented fragment of Modern Hebrew verbs couched in MicroCUF, an expressive constraint logic formalism.

It produces a finite-state oracle that efficiently restricts the constraint interpreter's search space. As a byproduct, unknown words can be analyzed without special mechanisms.

In the present paper, four ways of presenting text in a small display window were examined and compared to a Normal Page condition: rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), RSVP with a Completion Meter, Sentence-by-Sentence presentation, and Sentence-by-Sentence presentation with a Completion Meter. Dependent measures were reading efficiency - speed and comprehension - and preference. For designers of hardware or software with small display windows, the results suggest the following: (1) Though RSVP is disliked by readers, the present methods of allowing self-pacing and regressions in RSVP, unlike earlier tested methods, are efficient and feasible. (2) Slower reading in RSVP should be achieved by increasing pauses between sentences or by repeating sentences, not by decreasing the within-sentence rate.

Thus this can be seen by an off-site coach using low-bandwidth joint-motion data which permits real time animation. The metamorphosis involves altering the appearance and identity of the user and also creating a specific environment possibly in interaction with other virtual creatures.   A robust vision module is used to identify the user, based on very simple binary image processing in real time which also manages to resolve self-occlusion, correct for clothing/colour and other variations among users. Gestures are identified by locating key points at the shoulder, elbow and wrist joint, which are then recreated in an articulated humanoid model, which in this instance, representes a Kathakali dancer in elaborate traditional dress.

Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.   The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the root of a zerotree, or its branch.   The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).", "authors": "Oleg Kiselyov, Paul Fisher", "num_authors": 2, "published_date": "2000-03-15", "days_since_pub": 9173, "updated_date": "2000-03-15", "days_since_update": 9173, "primary_category": "cs.CV", "categories": "cs.CV, I.4.2; I.4.10; G.1.2", "n_categories": 2, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0003065v1", "title_word_count": 12, "title_word_diversity": 1.0, "title_avg_word_len": 7.083333333333333, "title_avg_sent_len": 14.0, "title_sentiment": "Positive", "abstract_word_count": 206, "abstract_word_diversity": 0.587378640776699, "abstract_avg_word_len": 5.762135922330097, "abstract_avg_sent_len": 29.625, "abstract_readability": 11.75, "abstract_sentiment": "Optimistic"}

{"id": "cs/9809018v1", "title": "Influencing Software Usage", "abstract": "Technology designers often strive to design systems that are flexible enough to be used in a wide range of situations. Software engineers, in particular, are trained to seek general solutions to problems. General solutions can be used not only to address the problem at hand, but also to address a wide range of problems that the designers may not have even anticipated. Sometimes designers wish to provide general solutions, while encouraging certain uses of their technology and discouraging or precluding others. They may attempt to influence the use of technology by ``hard-wiring'' it so that it only can be used in certain ways, licensing it so that those who use it are legally obligated to use it in certain ways, issuing guidelines for how it should be used, or providing resources that make it easier to use the technology as the designers intended than to use it in any other way.   This paper examines several cases where designers have attempted to influence the use of technology through one of these mechanisms. Such cases include key recovery encryption, Pegasus Mail, Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) Guidelines, Java, Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) Implementation Guide, Apple's style guidelines, and Microsoft Foundation Classes. In some of these cases, the designers sought to influence the use of technology for competitive reasons or in order to promote standardization or interoperability. However, in other cases designers were motivated by policy-related goals such as protecting privacy or free speech. As new technologies are introduced with the express purpose of advancing policy-related goals (for example, PICS and P3P), it is especially important to understand the roles designers might play in influencing the use of technology.", "authors": "Lorrie Faith Cranor, Rebecca N.

Consistent with this, there is more entry into Bell territories", "authors": "Federico Mini", "num_authors": 1, "published_date": "2001-09-06", "days_since_pub": 8633, "updated_date": "2001-09-06", "days_since_update": 8633, "primary_category": "cs.CY", "categories": "cs.CY, K.4.m Miscellaneous", "n_categories": 2, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109008v1", "title_word_count": 16, "title_word_diversity": 1.0, "title_avg_word_len": 5.625, "title_avg_sent_len": 17.0, "title_sentiment": "Positive", "abstract_word_count": 96, "abstract_word_diversity": 0.7083333333333334, "abstract_avg_word_len": 5.489583333333333, "abstract_avg_sent_len": 29.0, "abstract_readability": 29.18, "abstract_sentiment": "Positive"}
{"id": "cs/0109009v1", "title": "The Effect of Native Language on Internet Usage", "abstract": "Our goal is to distinguish between the following two hypotheses: (A) The Internet will remain disproportionately in English and will, over time, cause more people to learn English as second language and thus solidify the role of English as a global language. This outcome will prevail even though there are more native Chinese and Spanish speakers than there are native English speakers. (B) As the Internet matures, it will more accurately reflect the native languages spoken around the world (perhaps weighted by purchasing power) and will not promote English as a global language.   English's \"early lead\" on the web is more likely to persist if those who are not native English speakers frequently access the large number of English language web sites that are currently available. In that case, many existing web sites will have little incentive to develop non-English versions of their sites, and new sites will tend to gravitate towards English. The key empirical question, therefore, is whether individuals whose native language is not English use the Web, or certain types of Web sites, less than do native English speakers. In order to examine this issue empirically, we employ a unique data set on Internet use at the individual level in Canada from Media Metrix. Canada provides an ideal setting to examine this issue because English is one of the two official languages.   Our preliminary results suggest that English web sites are not a barrier to Internet use for French-speaking Quebecois. These preliminary results are consistent with the scenario in which the Internet will promote English as a global language.", "authors": "Neil Gandal, Carl Shapiro", "num_authors": 2, "published_date": "2001-09-06", "days_since_pub": 8633, "updated_date": "2001-09-06", "days_since_update": 8633, "primary_category": "cs.CY", "categories": "cs.CY, K.4.m Miscellaneous", "n_categories": 2, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0109009v1", "title_word_count": 8, "title_word_diversity": 1.0, "title_avg_word_len": 5.0, "title_avg_sent_len": 8.0, "title_sentiment": "Neutral", "abstract_word_count": 257, "abstract_word_diversity": 0.5369649805447471, "abstract_avg_word_len": 5.151750972762646, "abstract_avg_sent_len": 29.2, "abstract_readability": 36.42, "abstract_sentiment": "Optimistic"}
